## Overview

### Smart Referral Matching

AI-powered matching engine: Uses machine learning to match patients with the most suitable specialists based on:

- **Diagnosis**: Text-mining data from uploaded medical records (WIP).

- **Specialist availability**: Real-time availability updates from specialists.

- **Location**: Geographic preferences or restrictions, particularly helpful in rural/underserved areas.

- **Urgency**: Identifies high-risk cases needing faster care, routing them to the top of referral lists.

- **Referral prioritization**: Automates prioritization for cases that need immediate specialist intervention.

### Cost Estimation


- **Private medical system cost calculator**: Allows patients to receive a preliminary cost estimate for referrals to private healthcare services.

- **Insurance compatibility check**: Assesses whether suggested referrals are covered under the patientâ€™s insurance plan.
